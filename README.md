# Game of War

Run `node script.js` to start the game!

_Here we have my Game of War card game simulation. Only available in the console/terminal, this code puts the computer against itself to see which player can obtain all 52 cards._

_Going into this I wanted my game to be fully functional, run without any errors and require no user input. All three boxes have been checked and it's a fully functional code._

_One of my biggest challenges was debugging an issue where cards were randomly disappearing from the deck, which was solved by removing a useless function from the code. Secondly, the while loop was another obstacle I had to overcome, which took some time but ultimately got done._

**What I'm most proud of is that the game is fully functional and it **WORKS**! Moving forward I want to come back to this game and add some nice styling to the CSS and make it more than just a terminal game.**
